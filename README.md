 Login & Signup for Confessly (Help Needed)

 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a **Login and Signup system** for **Confessly**, an anonymous confession site where users can securely sign up and log in to post anonymous confessions. The goal is to implement a secure user authentication system, but I am facing some challenges in properly linking the login and signup functionality to handle user credentials.

This project is part of my **National Diploma (ND) final-year project**, and I am a student working on it as part of my academic requirements. I am seeking help with implementing the login and signup system and resolving a few issues related to user authentication.

Problem Statement

I need help with the following areas:

1. Linking frontend form inputs**: Ensuring the email and password from the signup/login forms are handled correctly.
2. Handling authentication flow**: Ensuring that the signup and login processes work smoothly, with proper redirects and user state management after login/signup.
3. Error handling**: Catching errors like incorrect passwords, unregistered emails, or other authentication issues and displaying them to the user.

If you have experience with building authentication systems, particularly for secure login/signup functionality, I would greatly appreciate your help with the issues mentioned above.

 Project Purpose

Confessly is designed as an anonymous confession platform, where users can share their confessions without revealing their identities. The login/signup system is crucial for allowing users to securely access their accounts before posting confessions.
